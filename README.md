Makes Chao fucking Explode under certain conditions. Typically when attacked.

Enable `Permadeath` in the config for a more immersive experience - Disabled by
default because it irreversably deletes your Chao.
⚠️⚠️⚠️ **Back up your save beforehand.** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

When a Chao fucking Explodes during a Chao Race, it can be a little bit
visually buggy due to workarounds having to be used.

Chao can not fucking Explode in Chao Karate (I tried, I gave up).

A ~~lot~~ *negligible* amount of Chao were harmed during the making of this
Mod.

This mod was **not** tested with
[Chao World Extended](https://gamebanana.com/mods/48840) or
[Enhanced Chao World](https://gamebanana.com/mods/48915) in mind.
Your experience may vary with those mods.
